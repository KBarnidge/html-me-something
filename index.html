				<h2>Day 1: Dinosaur Party!</h2>
				<p>We arrived in Salt Lake City early enough to explore the city a bit, but we decided to skip that and go straight to the George S. Eccles Dinosaur Park. 
					The park features life-size sculptures of over 100 dinosaurs, with a stunning view of the Wasatch mountains in the background.</p>

				<h2>Day 2: More Dinosaurs!</h2>
				<p>Our day included a four hour drive to Zion National Park, but first we stopped at the Natural History Museum. Rather than stylized sculptures of dinosaurs, they have a massive collection of full fossil skeletons.</p>

				<h2>Day 3: Zion National Park</h2>
				<p>Since we had a few days at Zion National Park, we started with the series of hikes accessible from the park shuttle. One of our planned hikes was shut down due to a recent rockslide, but we made up for it exploring other parts of the park.</p>

				<h2>Day 4: Kolob Canyon</h2>
				<p>The next morning, we took a short drive to the less crowded side of the park. We thought we were taking an easy 5 mile hike, but ended up clocking nearly 8 miles. The trail followed a stream and we got to cross back and forth as the rocks allowed. </p>

				<h2>Day 5: Full Moon at Bryce Canyon</h2>
				<p>About 2 hours away from Zion National Park is another national park called Bryce Canyon. It's certified as an International Dark Sky Park, which means there is limited light pollution and excellent stargazing. We did the 20 mile scenic drive through the mountains, then checked in at the Visitor Center. The park rangers encouraged us to come back after dark so we could see the full moon!</p>

				<h2>Day 6: Into the Hoodoos</h2>
				<p>Seeing the canyon by moonlight was great, but we weren't going to miss a chance to explore more of the landscape. We hiked down into the canyon's ampitheater and got to see the hoodoos up close, then had to work significantly harder to get back out again.</p>

				<h2>Day 7: Return to St. Louis</h2>
				<p>All good things must end, including vacation. We drove back to Salt Lake City, explored the city a bit, and talked about how much we're looking forward to coming back!</p>
